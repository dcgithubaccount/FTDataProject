<h1>test endpoint</h1>
<p>A <a href="http://camel.apache.org/test.html">Test Endpoint</a> is a
 <a href="http://camel.apache.org/mock.html">Mock Endpoint</a> for testing but it will
 pull all messages from the nested endpoint and use those as expected message body assertions.

  <tr>
    <td>assertPeriod</td>
    <td>long</td>
    <td>Sets a grace period after which the mock endpoint will re-assert
 to ensure the preliminary assertion is still valid.
 <p/>
 This is used for example to assert that <b>exactly</b> a number of messages 
 arrives. For example if {@link #expectedMessageCount(int)} was set to 5, then
 the assertion is satisfied when 5 or more message arrives. To ensure that
 exactly 5 messages arrives, then you would need to wait a little period
 to ensure no further message arrives. This is what you can use this
 {@link #setAssertPeriod(long)} method for.
 <p/>
 By default this period is disabled.

    <td>Specifies to only retain the first n'th number of received {@link Exchange}s.
 <p/>
 This is used when testing with big data, to reduce memory consumption by not storing
 copies of every {@link Exchange} this mock endpoint receives.
 <p/>
 <b>Important:</b> When using this limitation, then the {@link #getReceivedCounter()}
 will still return the actual number of received {@link Exchange}s. For example
 if we have received 5000 {@link Exchange}s, and have configured to only retain the first
 10 {@link Exchange}s, then the {@link #getReceivedCounter()} will still return <tt>5000</tt>
 but there is only the first 10 {@link Exchange}s in the {@link #getExchanges()} and
 {@link #getReceivedExchanges()} methods.
 <p/>
 When using this method, then some of the other expectation methods is not supported,
 for example the {@link #expectedBodiesReceived(Object...)} sets a expectation on the first
 number of bodies received.
 <p/>
 You can configure both {@link #setRetainFirst(int)} and {@link #setRetainLast(int)} methods,
 to limit both the first and last received.
 
 @param retainFirst  to limit and only keep the first n'th received {@link Exchange}s, use
                     <tt>0</tt> to not retain any messages, or <tt>-1</tt> to retain all.
